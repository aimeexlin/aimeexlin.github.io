                    This project was completed for BIOMENG 791, a fourth-year medical device design course. I worked
                    with four other fourth-year biomedical engineering students to design a device that addresses a
                    problem outlined by our client, Prof. Mark McKeage, a medical oncologist. Xerostomia, or dry mouth,
                    is a common side
                    effect of head and neck cancer, so we designed a solution to sustain saliva substitute delivery. The
                    design was a capsule containing medication attached to the user’s teeth with brackets inspired by
                    orthodontic clasps. The project also considered ethical issues, social impact, safety risks, and
                    international regulations. I contributed to the research of medications and delivery mechanisms, CAD
                    of the capsule and its packaging on Autodesk Fusion 360, planning a suite of design verification
                    tests, performing a computational stress analysis of the capsule, and report writing. Prototyping
                    was not required for the completion of this project.

                    This project was completed for EXERSCI 309, a practicum project in exercise science taken as an
                    elective. I was supervised by Dr Yanxin Zhang from the Department of Exercise Science. I
                    investigated whether performing joint mobilisation tasks such as shoulder, hip, and pelvic joint
                    mobilisation increase the risk for work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) in physical
                    therapists using motion capture data collected from Fujian University of Traditional Chinese
                    Medicine. Although I didn’t
                    collect the data used in the project, prior to Covid-19 lockdown during the semester I learnt how to
                    use the Azure Kinect system to capture motion data in the biomechanics lab. I carried out
                    biomechanical and ergonomic analyses using an existing software to find RULA and REBA angles, low
                    back compression forces, and strength capabilities in the joints at the most awkward posture for
                    each task for every subject. For each dependent variable measured, a two-way mixed ANOVA was
                    performed using R. The results showed that all three joint mobilisation tasks investigated can
                    increase the risk of WMSDs for both female and male physical therapists.

                    This project was completed for BIOMENG 341, a third-year bioinstrumentation and design course. I
                    worked with four other third-year biomedical engineering students to design and create a system that
                    replicates the distension of the frog vocal sac. We modelled the system using a balloon inflated and
                    deflated through a syringe and investigated the relationships between pressure, temperature, and
                    volume, as well as the flow impedance and stress-strain relationships. Due to Covid-19 lockdown
                    during the semester, the project was split into subsystems so the work could be more fairly divided
                    between the group members. I contributed to the volume measurement by analysing a video recording of
                    the balloon being inflated and deflated. The video was recorded by another group member who had set
                    up the experiment and also recorded pressure and temperature data simultaneously. The analysis was
                    done in LabVIEW and exported the measurements so all the data generated thus far could be used by
                    other group members to analyse the flow impedance, stress, and strain. We were able to successfully
                    measure everything required for the project.

                    Lara. I used
                    SOLIDWORKS to design a set of standard manipulation objects capable of encasing a Shimmer3 wireless
                    multi-sensor unit capable of streaming 9 degrees of freedom inertial sensing information. Two sets
                    were constructed, one using Ecoflex 00-30 silicone and the other using 3D printed PLA plastic. I
                    also imported the Shimmer3 data into MATLAB to visualise the movement of the standard manipulation
                    objects and was able to estimate object orientations in near real-time. Positions were unable to be
                    estimated accurately due to bias drift.
