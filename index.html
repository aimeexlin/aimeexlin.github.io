                </p>
                <p class="details" id="8">
                    This project was completed for EXERSCI 309, a practicum project in exercise science taken as an
                    elective.
                    I was supervised by Dr Yanxin Zhang from the Department of Exercise Science.
                    I investigated whether performing joint mobilisation tasks such as shoulder, hip, and pelvic joint
                    mobilisation
                    increase the risk for work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) in physical therapists using
                    motion capture data collected from a study conducted in China.
                    Although I didn’t collect the data used in the project, prior to Covid-19 lockdown during the
                    semester I learnt how to use the Azure Kinect system to capture motion data in the biomechanics lab.
                    I carried out biomechanical and ergonomic analyses using an existing software to find RULA and REBA
                    angles, low back compression forces, and strength capabilities in the joints at the most awkward
                    posture for each task for every subject.
                    For each dependent variable measured, a two-way mixed ANOVA was performed using R.
                    The results showed that all three joint mobilisation tasks investigated can increase the risk of
                    WMSDs for both female and male physical therapists.

                    This project was completed for BIOMENG 341, a third-year bioinstrumentation and design course.
                    I worked with four other third-year biomedical engineering students to design and create a system
                    that replicates the distension of the frog vocal sac.
                    We modelled the system using a balloon inflated and deflated through a syringe and investigated the
                    relationships between pressure, temperature, and volume, as well as the flow impedance and
                    stress-strain relationships.
                    Due to Covid-19 lockdown during the semester, the project was split into subsystems so the work
                    could be more fairly divided between the group members.
                    I contributed to the volume measurement by analysing a video recording of the balloon being inflated
                    and deflated.
                    The video was recorded by another group member who had set up the experiment and also recorded
                    pressure and temperature data simultaneously.
                    The analysis was done in LabVIEW and exported the measurements so all the data generated thus far
                    could be used by other group members to analyse the flow impedance, stress, and strain.
                    We were able to successfully measure everything required for the project.

                    I was supervised by Professor Leo Cheng, Dr Nira Paskaranandavadivel, and Jaime Lara.
                    I constructed two sets of standard manipulation objects capable of encasing a Shimmer3 wireless
                    multi-sensor unit capable of streaming 9 degrees of freedom inertial sensing information.
                    One set was constructed using Ecoflex 00-30 silicone and the other using 3D printed PLA plastic.
                    I also extracted the Shimmer3 data to visualise the movement of the standard manipulation objects
                    and was able to estimate object orientations in near real-time.
                    Positions were unable to be estimated accurately due to bias drift.

                    The device operated by measuring the reflectances of red, green, and blue LEDs using a photodiode.
                    I contributed to the design and testing of the circuitry and software, which involved design and
                    programming on Altium Designer and LabVIEW, and testing with a breadboard and the assembled device.

                    rest homes in Auckland by four couriers travelling only using Auckland’s public transportation
                    system.
                    I developed an algorithm using Python that split the rest homes into four groups based on geographic
                    location and used a network to return the shortest distance path and time taken for each group.

                    I wrote MATLAB code that creates two different kinds of images from an arbitrary sequence of images
                    that feature someone (or something) moving through a static scene.
                    These images could be from a series of photos or a selection of frames taken from a movie.
                    One kind of image was an action shot, a single image that features the moving person or object shown
                    in different locations.
                    The other kind of image was one where the action has been removed, eliminating the moving person (or
                    object) from the image, leaving only the static scene visible.

                    This project was completed for the New York Academy of Sciences’ Junior Academy Wildfires: Tracking,
                    Prevention, and Containment Challenge.
                    I worked with five other high school students from India, Ukraine, and the US to design a solution
                    to mitigate power-line caused fires.
                    Our solution was a predictive analytics software that uses data from weather stations, government
                    data on historical and ongoing fires fires,
                    and citizen reports on fallen power lines and dry vegetation from an app to identify high-risk areas
                    and suggest management plans for these areas for local governments and communities.
                    I contributed to the background research by creating and sending out a survey to residents of
                    California, and the design of the predictive analytics software user interface.
                    We were finalists in the challenge and presented our project to 100+ attendees at the 2019 Global
