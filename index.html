                        This paired project was completed for my Honours degree. I created scaled and subject-specific
                        models of
                        the lower limb of a typically developed child and child with cerebral palsy to compare the
                        estimated structure and function
                        of the models using Python and OpenSim. I found that the differences in structure lead to
                        differences in the estimated joint kinematics and muscle forces,
                        highlighting the importance of having accurate geometries in musculoskeletal models.
                        The methods established can also be used to investigate relationships
                        between the accuracy of modelling methods and the severity of a child's
                        cerebral palsy.

                        Analyses were carried out on motion capture data using existing software to find RULA and REBA

                        This project was completed with five other high school students for the New York Academy of
                        Sciences‚Äô Wildfires Challenge. We designed a
                        predictive analytics software that uses weather stations data, historical
                        and ongoing fires data, and citizen reports on fallen power lines and dry vegetation to
                        identify and manage high-risk areas. I contributed to the background research by surverying
                        residents of California and the design of the user interface. We were
                        challenge finalists, presented our project at the 2019 Global STEM
                        Alliance Summit and were featured in the <a class="textlink" target="_blank_"
